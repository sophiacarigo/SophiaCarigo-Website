        <p class="lead mb-4">I was born and raised in San Francisco, California. I am thankful to have grown up in a unique city like this because it has influenced me to become the person I am today. The "hustle-and-bustle" culture, in addition to its diversity, are my biggest takeaways from growing up here. I enjoy always having something to do, whether it be for pleasure or for work. I believe its because San Francisco is a busy city (definitely nothing like New York) but there is something motivating and far-reaching about looking forward to doing something. The diversity of the city is like no other. I like to say that San Francisco is a hub of its own. From the architecture to the neighborhoods and people. This environment has exposed me to understand different perspectives and privileges of life, from the rich, poor, or people of different backgrounds. I was exposed to low income communities where it was difficult to gain healthcare. Through SF initiatives, I was able to gain an internship where I got in touch with the people of these communities to help better their lives. This is what truly influenced me to want to get into the healthcare field. <br><br>

I am currently a Biology major pursuing to become a Physician's Assistant. I want to become a Physician's Assistant because I am passionate about healthcare and advocating for others. I believe that this career is the perfect avenue that suits my outgoing personality, willingness to help others and interest in healthcare advancements. In addition, I want to specifically be involved in family practice, as I was inspired by my own Physician's Assistant. I am confident that my past experiences now contribute to my professional growth- I have developed strong leadership, teamwork and problem solving skills. Nevertheless, I am always open and eager to new opportunities that can help me become a better, well-suited Physician's Assistant. <br><br>
       I have 3+ years of lab experience in the organic chemistry, chemistry and biology aspects. In the laboratory, I gather and process data, draw appropriate conclusions, and communicate those conclusions in a cogent presentation. The dual experiences of learning in the classroom and at the laboratory allowed me to connect academic ideas to practical situations, and real career opportunities that promote innovation. 
My past employments are fairly diverse in the responsibilities and duties they entail. However, they reflect and reinforce my ability to adapt to different situations, and willingness to learn with others on the job, fueled by positive interactions with clients and coworkers of diverse ages, backgrounds, and professional standings.
My past and current positions involve plenty of human interaction - something that is important in the health care sector. I have learned how to work logically, through trial and errors with a team.   In conjunction with an intrinsic motivation to learn, through future opportunities, I would gain more essential skills that can contribute to my professional growth.
